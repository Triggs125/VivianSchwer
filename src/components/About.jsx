        Hello! My name is Vivian Schwer, and I'm a St. Louis born and raised girl 
        who moved to Kansas City to explore my passion for pharmacy. 
        I am currently interested in both acute and ambulatory care settings and am 
        interested in pursuing a residency. I have over two years of hospital experience. 
        I enjoy interprofessional collaboration to seek out the best individualized care for patients!
